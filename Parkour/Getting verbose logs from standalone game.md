Run the game with logs:

```
"C:\Program Files\UE_4.16\Engine\Binaries\Win64\UE4Editor.exe" "C:\Users\sam\Documents\Unreal Projects\M
ultiplayerPrototypes\Parkour\Parkour.uproject" -game -log
```

Open up the consle with the key below escape. Type:

```
Log LogOnline Verbose
```

You can find this is what we need by looking in the code.
